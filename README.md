#COVID 19 Infographic - Singapore
This is an interactive infographic website, aimed towards providing viewers with a visualization on the raw dataset provided by the Singapore government website on recent COVID-19 cases. The website contains various elements that informs viewers on the situation in Singapore - ``` Affected areas/clusters, Location of hospitals, Details on each cases and the rate of transmission. ```

## UX
```These are tough times, .``` 

My goal is to visualize how our current healthcare resources are holding up against the rising COVID-19 cases and present it to viewers through the use of interactive map, bar chart, line chart and pie chart. 


## Technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap (4.3)
* Javascript
* JQuery
* Axios
* Leaflet
* Chart.js

## Features
1. Hover effect implemented on navigation bar and call to action button.
2. Logo redirects to Homepage (index.html) upon clicking.
3. About me redirects to about page (about.html) upon clicking.
4. Skill and Projects directs to anchor points on (index.html) upon clicking.
5. Use of transparent text, background image and position fixed to create image behind text scrolling effect.
6. Neumorphism cards are implemented through the use of white and black box shadows. 
7. Hover over the Neumorphism cards will reverse the shadows, giving it a "pushed-in" effect.
8. In Gallery section, use of display block, inline-block and hover transform to create mobile responsive and hover out effect.
9. Responsive to mobile IOS and Android device.
10. Page footer has social media links.
11. About me page allows employers to download my CV, get info on my contact. 

## Features Left to Implement
* I would like to implement javascript for a "coin" effect on the logo. Add more animation for image floating in upon scroll, change the navigation bar to a hamburger, include the PDF file of my CV into the website.
* For functionality, I would add a section for employers to write and send an email to me directly from the website itself. 
* To improve the mobile responsiveness of my about page "Hi, my name..."

## Testing
Employers will be able to view my video the instance they enter the webpage. 

All links have been tested to ensure correct re-direction to desired destination.
1. Logo -> `about.html`
2. Project -> `index.html#projects`
3. Skills -> `index.html#skills`
4. Contact -> `about.html#contact`
5. Facebook -> `My Facebook profile`
6. Twitter -> `My Twitter Profile`
7. Instagram -> `My Instagram Profile`
8. LinkedIn -> `My linkedIn Profile`
9. Github -> `My Github Profile`
10. Download CV -> `#`  (not linked)

Upon clicking `Contact`, user will be re-directed to about me page, anchor at contact.

To ensure compatibility and responsiveness, the site was tested across multiple browsers such as Chrome, Safari and Internet Explorer and on multiple android devices - Galaxy S5, Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL and iOS devices - iPhone 5-X, iPad and iPad Pro.

Upon testing, the use of webkit for text transparent of the Home page was not compatible with Internet Explorer.
